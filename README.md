Group 6 Directory - Methods 2022

The following directory explores our research, which asks if and how Twitter data can be analyzed to quantify patient sentiment towards antidepressants. We use Twitterâ€™s API to extract user-provided data and then different sentiment analysis packages to quantify patient perception of the 5 most commonly prescribed ntidepressants.

**Packages Required**
  
    Python:
        - sys
        - matplotlib.pyplot
        - pandas
        - numpy
        - vaderSentiment
        - azure.core.credentials, AzureKeyCredential
        - azure.ai.textanalytics, TextAnalyticsClient
        
    Julia:
        - StatsPlots
        - PyPlot
        - PyCall
        - VaderSentiment
        - HTTP
        - JSON
        - CSV
        - DataFrames
        - TextAnalysis
    

**Retrieval**

In order to run the retrieval scripts, please first set up your [Twitter API account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api). Paste your Bearer Token in the retrieval.jl or retrieval_academic_access.jl. Depending on your access permssion, run one  of the following through terminal:

```
julia retrieval.jl

julia retrieval_academic_access.jl
```

These files will retrieve the raw tweets for each  antidepressant and store them in the raw-data directory.


**Processing**

Next, run the following script:

```
julia preprocess.jl
```

This will read all the raw twitter data files,  standardize them, and store them accordingly for each antidepressant as text file under the data directory. 

**Analysis**

For the sentiment  analysis, we choose to use Azure's Text Analytics Service and NLTK (VADER). For the former, [first create your account and service endpoint in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/sentiment-opinion-mining/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python#code-example). Next, update the endpoint and key variables in  the sentiment_analysis_azure.py. Next, run the followings to conduct the sentiment analysis:

```
python3 sentiment_analysis_azure.py

python3 sentiment_analysis_nltk.py

julia sentiment_analysis_vader.jl
```

Each script will use their corresponding packages to run sentiment analysis on the data. They will then output the polarity results for each drug in a new text file under the visualization directory. 

**Visualization**

Once the analysis output have successfully been saved, run  the following  scripts to generate the visualizations of the sentiment analysis results for each package:

```
julia visualzation_azure.jl

julia visualzation_nltk.jl

julia visualzation_vader.jl
```

Each script will create a save a series of visualizations with the results of the sentiment analysis for each antidepressant under the visualization directory.
