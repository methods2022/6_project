2|@yourdarc Ever tried trazodone or Lunesta or hydroxyzine for sleep?  Trazodone works fine for me. Paroxetine is very old, was hell for me. The most often prescribed ADâ€™s are Venlaxafine HCL XR (euro countries say safe meds are dangerous) also Escitalopramâ€¦viibryd, trintellix are new
3|@slaycalz other awful ones were latuda and viibryd , both gave me oculogyric crisis . basically my eyes rolled up uncontrollably and it was fucking awful esp considering i already have chronic headaches , it made it much worse . and i had to leave school because i couldn't read or see shit
4|@KDenne13 Are you on BOP insurance, and if so did Express Scripts give you a hard time about Viibryd since there is no generic? Iâ€™d been on it for over a year when we switched from Optum, and for a while it looked like Express Scripts wasnâ€™t going to cover my Viibryd. (They finally did.)
5|@KDenne13 Brain zaps were AWFUL with Cymbalta. With Viibryd I have skipped a whole day and no brain zaps.
6|My Viibryd is in the car. I usually take it before bed. I donâ€™t feel like going back outside. I think Iâ€™ll take it on my way to work in the morning. Maybe it will last longer that way anyway?

10|@jenbretty Nothing wrong with that. I started a new one..Viibryd.  I  have to admit pretty impressive. If it makes you feel better, take the edge off. Do it.
