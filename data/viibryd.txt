2|@carrie4beto I had a similar issue with Viibryd. Had to find another similar med the insurance would cover.

4|@yourdarc Ever tried trazodone or Lunesta or hydroxyzine for sleep?  Trazodone works fine for me. Paroxetine is very old, was hell for me. The most often prescribed AD’s are Venlaxafine HCL XR (euro countries say safe meds are dangerous) also Escitalopram…viibryd, trintellix are new|yourdarc  tried trazodone  lunesta  hydroxyzine  sleep  trazodone  fine   paroxetine     hell      prescribed ad  venlaxafine hcl xr euro countries  safe meds  dangerous  escitalopram…viibryd trintellix

I’d been on it for over a year when we switched from Optum, and for a while it looked like Express Scripts wasn’t going to cover my Viibryd. (They finally did.)|kdenne    bop insurance     express scripts    hard time  viibryd     generic           switched  optum      looked  express scripts wasn   cover  viibryd  finally
