1|Good news is my switch from Pristiq to Effexor was generally painless. None of the nasty side effects that I’ve gotten trying to quit Pristiq cold turkey. Bad news is this stuff is definitely not as effective as Pristiq and I’ve been in a slump for about 10 days now. 😪| news   switch  pristiq  effexor   painless none   nasty  effects  ve gotten trying  quit pristiq cold turkey bad news   stuff  definitely   effective  pristiq  ve    slump    days  😪

198|@BeccaLizz I’m on Pristiq (an SNRI) and it’s working really well for me. Also on Concerta &amp; guanfacine for ADHD. I also can’t say enough about how genetic testing helped me find the right med, if you have access to that.|beccalizz   pristiq  snri          concerta amp guanfacine  adhd        genetic testing helped     med    access  
199|@BeccaLizz I’ve seen Effexor suggested here, and I would recommend pristiq instead! It’s very similar to Effexor—in fact it’s actually just the metabolite of it, and it has a longer half life. Way less side effects. I’ve had both and I much prefer pristiq.|beccalizz ve seen effexor suggested     recommend pristiq instead   similar  effexor   actually   metabolite        half life    effects ve      prefer pristiq

201|@BrettButler1111 @TADavis28966282 I’ve taken an antidepressant for 33 years. Tofranil &gt; Effexor &gt; Pristiq Way back before I started taking Tofranil, I had panic attacks EVERY DAY. I could not eat. It was horrific. I wouldn’t stop taking my bp medication - so why would I stop my antidepressant?|brettbutler tadavis ve   antidepressant    tofranil gt effexor gt pristiq     started taking tofranil   panic attacks  day    eat   horrific  wouldn stop taking  bp medication      stop  antidepressant
